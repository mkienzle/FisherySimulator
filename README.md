# Fishery simulator
The purpose of this repository is to create code to simulate fishery data. The fishery simulator is an essential component of a project to enhance understanding of stock assessment method: our work follows the principle that if a (stock assessment) method does not provide the correct answer using synthetic data, it is unlikely to work with real data.

The first objective of this collaboration is to create synthetic datasets for a single species, single area, single fleet fishery.

A description of the models used in the fishery simulator is provided [here][https://www.overleaf.com/7424895544mdzrytychpvy].
